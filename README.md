# Summary
Dialed Up CTF is a music and phreaking themed mini-[CTF](https://ctfd.io/whats-a-ctf/)
that is completely self-contained in [an .mp3 file](https://github.com/project-mammoth/dialed-up-ctf/raw/main/Dialed%20Up%20CTF.mp3).
To just listen to the song check it out on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/dialed-up),
or for the full video [check here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euMZYqDG4Sc).
The official [CTF contest page is here](https://ctf.projectmammoth.com).

This mini-CTF is jeopardy style with 10 challenges.  The challenges are puzzle
based and generally involve music or phreaking related themes.  No software or
binary exploitation skills are required, but some challenges are significantly
easier to solve with coding/scripting.

The contest will run for just over a week until 2022-08-15 00:00 UTC.

# About the song
We tried to add a wide array of phreaking related sounds and samples including
~30 different ring tones, DTMF, a rotary phone, lots of modem noises and
carrier recording samples.  Hope you like it, we had fun with it :). 

The official contest version of the song file can be found
[here](https://github.com/project-mammoth/dialed-up-ctf/raw/main/Dialed%20Up%20CTF.mp3).
You can also listen to the song [on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/projectmammoth/dialed-up),
but note that only the [official .mp3](https://github.com/project-mammoth/dialed-up-ctf/raw/main/Dialed%20Up%20CTF.mp3)
has the CTF contest data encoded in it.

Note: The [contest mp3 file](https://github.com/project-mammoth/dialed-up-ctf/raw/main/Dialed%20Up%20CTF.mp3)
is benign and does not contain any exploits or malicious payloads.  Other
than having some extra metadata embedded in it, it's a normal mp3 file
and safe to open.  Here's the

for reference.

# Notes
* The hints are not in the .mp3 file and are only available on ctf.projectmammoth.com with a registered user.
* The video links in the notes sections of the challenges are sometimes hints, but sometimes just for fun :).
