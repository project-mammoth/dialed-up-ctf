# Summary
Dialed Up CTF is a music and phreaking themed mini-CTF that is completely
self-contained in an .mp3 file.

The mini-CTF is jeopardy style with ~7 challenges.  The challenges are puzzle
based and generally involve music or phreaking related themes.  No software or
binary exploitation skills are required, but some challenges are much easier to
solve with coding/scripting.

The challenge you are seeing now is just a teaser release. Please visit
https://projectmammoth.com at 2022-08-06:00:00 GMT for the final competition
CTF.

# About the song
We tried to add an abundance of phreaking related sounds and samples including
~30 different ring tones, DTMF, a rotary phone, lots of modem noises and
carrier recording samples.  Hope you like it, we had fun with it :). 

The original song file can be found
[here](https://github.com/project-mammoth/dialed-up-ctf/raw/main/Dialed%20Up%20CTF.mp3).
